		You have two ropes. Each burns completely in exactly one hour. However, they are different lengths and thus burn at different rates. Also, along each rope the width & material changes, so they burn at different rates at different places. The only thing you know is that they each burn completely in one hour exactly.
		You have a lighter. How do you measure exactly 45 minutes?
	</summary>

	1) Light one rope from both ends. This will take 30 minutes to burn up.
	2) At the same time, light the other rope.
	3) When the first rope finishes burning, the other rope still has 30 minutes left to burn up. Light the other side of the second rope.
